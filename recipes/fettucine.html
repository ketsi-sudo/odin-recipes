    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>It calls for 8 basic ingredients and comes together in 20 minutes, 
        but it still tastes like it could have come from a restaurant. 
        Simple, flavorful, and indulgent—that’s this fettuccine Alfredo</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> pound fettuccine pasta </li> 
        <li> 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, sliced into pats
        <li> 1½ cups heavy cream </li>
        <li> 1 garlic clove, grated </li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon sea salt </li>
        <li> 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li> ground black pepper </li>
        <li> Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the pasta according to the package instructions, cooking until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the starchy pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over low heat. While whisking, pour in the cream. Add the garlic and salt and cook, whisking occasionally, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until thickened. Add half the Parmesan and whisk until melted.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and toss to coat, then add the remaining cheese and toss again until it melts into the sauce. If the sauce becomes too thick, add the reserved pasta water as needed to loosen it. I typically add around ½ cup.</li>
        <li>Season to taste and serve topped with freshly ground black pepper and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
